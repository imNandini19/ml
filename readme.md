# 📘 Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey**!  
This repository contains all the **ML algorithms I learn and implement** as part of my hands-on practice.  
Each topic is organized into neat folders with Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and reproducibility.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository
I am learning **Machine Learning**, and this repo serves as my personal notebook collection where I upload:

- ML algorithms I study  
- Hands-on implementations  
- Real dataset experiments  
- Notes and organized categories  

This will grow as I continue learning.
